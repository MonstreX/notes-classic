## 1) Goals and constraints

- Local-first, portable desktop app.

- All data lives next to the executable by default, but storage can be relocated via Settings.
- UI must be fast and deterministic.
- Editor must preserve complex HTML.
- Search must include OCR results.
- Attachments must be stored locally with original filenames.
- No React; vanilla DOM rendering.
- Keep IPC boundaries strict.
